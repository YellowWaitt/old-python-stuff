# Some old stuff

A collection of old stuff I did during my first year at the university when i was learning python. The codes are old and a bit ugly but the products works.

## [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)

A script that simulate the behavior of a langton's ant. The script allow you to add several ant at the same time.\
I made it after seeing this video : [La fourmi de Langton - ScienceEtonnante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZRYGxF6D3w).

## [Chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game)

A concept to easily draw some fractal, I was inspired by this video : [Chaos Game - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs).\
The script allow you to place some attractor points (left clic) and a starting point (right clic), then the magic happens.

An implementation of the classic board game.
